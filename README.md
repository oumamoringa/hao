## HAO_APP

## Introduction

80% of city residents are tenants. What this necesarrily means is that majority of the housing
in the city is owned by just a few groups and individuals. It isnâ€™t uncommon to find one
landlord wning several hundred apartment/property units.

## Problem Statement

Seeing as landlords often manage multiple property units, there is significant data that needs
to be collected for efficient management. In the best of scenarios, Landlords typically use
spreadsheets which are cumbersome to access across multiple devices and complicated to
manipulate, and in the worst of scenarios, some landlords use the old fashioned pencil and
notebook, which is archaic to say the least. There is a wealth of data that can be useful for a
landlord if the proper data management is done.

manipulate their property data and gather data intelligence to make strategic decisions.
